# Bang-A-Dice-Game
A re-creation of a dice game called Bang! This project taught me a lot about object oriented programming as well as how to work in a team.
This project was created by:
- Blane Brown
- Javier Vasquez
- Zachary Hunt

## Project Description
This project was created in Java using object-oriented programming principles. This project was completed as a final assignment for my object-oriented programming
college course. While the UI may be limited in its visuals, the game plays exactly how the real life version does. It includes computer players to play against which
will adapt their playstyle based on whats going on. It also includes all expansions the game has and they can be turned on or off.The purpose behind this assignment 
was to better understand how OOP works and how to properly work together as a team to create a large project.
